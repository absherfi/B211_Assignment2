# B211_Assignment2
The purpose of this project is to create a password generator, to generate memorable or random passwords. The memorable passwords are generated using n random words, adding a random 1 digit number to each word, and then concatenating them using a hyphen. The random words come from a csv file containing top 100,000 english nouns. The random passwords are generated by selecting n random characers from different character types. The character types include lower case, upper case, numbers and/or punctuation symbols. The random password generator has an arguement to specify the length and if punctuation symbols are to be included. When a password is generated the password as well as the time it was created (day, date, and time) should be appended to a file titled "Generated_Passwords.txt". Both types of passwords (memorable or random) should have their own "Generated_Passwords.txt" files, contained in different directories titled "Memorable" and "Random" respectively. In this assignment I used OS, String, Datetime and Random.
